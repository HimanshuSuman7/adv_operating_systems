Interaction: I did not interact with Kumar Harshwardhan regarding this assignment.

File Structure:
    1. main.c : contains the driver code of the program
    2. project.h : header file containing all necessary declarations
    3. threads.c : contains function to create threads and its runner functions as per the requirement of the assignment
    5. makefile : make file which is required for execution
    6. input1.txt : contains an example (odd scenario) of the input file

How to compile the code?
    1. unzip the file using the terminal
    2. locate the folder in the terminal and type "make"
        (this will create object files named as "threads.o" and "result.out")
    3. now type "./result.out" followed by name of the input file as parameter to execute the program

Description for the program:
    - First step is to prepare an input file containing the complex numbers. Please restrict yourself from using any other format other than (a + ib), where a and b are integers and it is mandatory to add spaces as per the format.
    - Now, that the input file is ready, driver function will take the command line arguments and store the contents of the file.
    - Driver function will print the complex numbers from the file.
    - Then, it will print the pthread_id, pid and threadid of the parent process.
    - Now, the code will proceed to create the threads by calling create_threads() function. Here, the threads will be created and intermediate results of complex multiplication will be printed. 
    - Here in threads.c, I have created 3 runner functions based on different scenarios that I encountered.
    - And finally, I have taken care of the odd and even case. 

What I was able to do and not able to do?
    - I was able to complete all the requirements of the assignment.
